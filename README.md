📈 Advertising Sales Prediction using Linear Regression

This project explores how different advertising media affect sales.  
I used a simple linear regression model to analyze the impact of ad spending across TV, Radio, and Newspaper — then created a combined feature called `Times` to capture total ad spending.

📊 Dataset
The dataset contains advertising spending data and corresponding sales.  
It includes the following features:
- TV
- Radio
- Newspaper
- Sales (target)

🧠 Objective
To predict sales using a single combined feature:  
**`Times = TV + Radio + Newspaper`**

⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

📉 Evaluation Metrics
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 6.42  
- **R-squared (R² Score):** 0.765
